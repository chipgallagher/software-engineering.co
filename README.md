## What was this site?
This site was supposed to be a complete shopping website, with a functional search bar, account system, shopping cart and item database.

We were given a few weeks to complete this project, from about halfway through October until the first week of December, 2020.

In true 2020 fashion, one of the team members contracted COVID and we were not able to complete as much of the project as we wanted.
## What was completed?
- Basic HTML for a homepage, item categories, items, and a "Thank you for your purchase" page.
- A MySQL database containing an item ID number, title, description, and a filepath to an image
- Item and category pages that queries a MySQL database via PHP, based on item ID or category
- A search page that queries a MySQL database via PHP, based on item name
## What wasn't completed?
- A user login page (40% complete)
- A payment details page (20% complete)
## Tools used
- MySQL Workbench (SQL scripting and data manipulation)
- Adobe Dreamweaver (HTML editing)
- Atom (PHP scripting)
- Adobe Photoshop (Image editing)

This project was created with very little security in mind, and it is definitely rough around the edges. Use the code if you want, but be warned!
